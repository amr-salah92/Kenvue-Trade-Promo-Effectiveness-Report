# **Kenvue Trade & Promo Effectiveness Report**

## **1. Executive Summary**

Kenvue’s current trade and promotional strategies are eroding profitability, with **negative ROI across all promo types**, **high discount leakage** concentrated in a small number of SKUs and retailers, and **market share losses** during sales downturns.

Even more critically, **price elasticity analysis reveals extreme sensitivity across nearly all SKUs**, meaning small pricing changes cause disproportionately large volume shifts — both opportunities and risks.

**Key Pain Points:**

* **SAR 93,671.46 total net losses** over the period.
* **42% of discount leakage** originates from e-commerce channels (*Amazon*, *Noon*).
* **All promo types** deliver negative ROI; BOGO and deep price discounts are most margin-destructive.
* **Price strategy misalignment** — heavy discounts applied to low-responsiveness SKUs.
* **Competitive share loss** concentrated in specific SKU–region–retailer combinations.
* **Elasticities in the 20–33 range** for most SKUs, magnifying both potential gains and risks from pricing decisions.

### **B. Promotional ROI by Type**

| PromoType     | Avg. ROI |
| ------------- | -------- |
| Display       | -0.97    |
| Digital       | -2.10    |
| PriceDiscount | -3.82    |

* All mechanics **negative ROI**.
* **BOGO** and **Price Discounts** destroy the most margin.
* Digital promotions underperform — likely poor targeting/conversion.

### **C. Trade Investment ROI**

* Stand-alone: \~0% ROI — **no measurable uplift**.
* Combined with promotions: all negative (-0.89 to -1.24).
* Pairing investments with promos currently **destroys value**.

### **D. Price Elasticity Insights**

* **All SKUs highly elastic** (>1) — most in **20–33** range.

* **Top Elastic SKUs:**

  * Clean & Clear *PROD\_041\_100pcs* — 33.71
  * Neutrogena *PROD\_005\_100pcs* — 33.19
  * Johnson’s *PROD\_013\_30ml* — 31.33
  * Listerine *PROD\_010\_200g* — 31.25
