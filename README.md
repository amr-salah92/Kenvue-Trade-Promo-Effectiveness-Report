# **Kenvue Trade & Promo Effectiveness Report**

## **1. Executive Summary**

Kenvue’s current trade and promotional strategies are eroding profitability, with negative ROI across all promo types, high discount leakage concentrated in a small number of SKUs and retailers, and market share losses during sales downturns.

Even more critically, price elasticity analysis reveals extreme sensitivity across nearly all SKUs, meaning small pricing changes cause disproportionately large volume shifts — both opportunities and risks.

**Trade Spend Efficiency (TSE)** analysis shows that **Digital and Price Discount mechanics destroy value**, while Display and BOGO deliver only marginal or breakeven returns. This highlights poor promo–investment alignment and the urgent need for a data-driven framework.

**Key Pain Points:**
* SAR 831M total net Sales over the period.
* SAR 93,671.46 total net losses over the period.
* 42% of discount leakage originates from e-commerce channels (Amazon, Noon).
* All promo types deliver negative ROI; BOGO and deep price discounts are most margin-destructive.
* **TSE confirms Digital (-0.239) and Price Discounts (-0.004) destroy value.**
* Competitive share loss concentrated in specific SKU–region–retailer combinations.
* Elasticities in the 20–33 range for most SKUs, magnifying both potential gains and risks from pricing decisions.
* Average GTN Percentage: in all sales data = \~79% and for loss-generating SKUs/channels = -111.4%.

## **2. Key Findings**

### **A. Trade Spend Efficiency (TSE) by PromoType**

```
Display          0.0128  
BOGO             0.0044  
PriceDiscount   -0.0042  
Digital         -0.2393
```

🔎 **Insights:**

* **Display (TSE = +0.0128):** Slightly positive, but weak → only \~1.3% uplift per SAR spent.
* **BOGO (TSE = +0.0044):** Barely efficient; high volume but little payback.
* **Price Discount (TSE = -0.0042):** Value-destructive; discounts reduce profitability.
* **Digital (TSE = -0.2393):** Strongly negative; poor targeting and inflated digital costs drive losses.
---

### **B. Promotional ROI by Type**

| PromoType     | Avg. ROI |
| ------------- | -------- |
| Display       | -0.97    |
| Digital       | -2.10    |
| PriceDiscount | -3.82    |
| BOGO          | -5.08    |

* All mechanics **negative ROI**.
* **BOGO** and **Price Discounts** destroy the most margin.
* Digital promotions underperform — likely poor targeting/conversion.

---

### **C. Trade Investment ROI**

* Stand-alone: \~0% ROI — **no measurable uplift**.

| InvestmentType     | ROI |
| ------------- | -------- |
| Shelf Space Optimization       | 0.0000  |
| Co-op Advertising        | 0.0000     |
| New Product Listing   | 0.0000     |
| Marketing Support        | 0.0000   |
| Display Fee          | -0.0000     |
  
* Combined with promotions: all negative (-0.89 to -1.24).
* Pairing investments with promos currently **destroys value**.

| InvestmentType     | ROI |
| ------------- | -------- |
| Display Fee          | -0.6699     |
| Co-op Advertising        | -0.8363    |
| New Product Listing   | -0.8839  |
| Marketing Support        | -0.9065    |
| Shelf Space Optimization       | -0.9237  |

* **Average GTN (Gross-to-Net) percentage:**

  * Across all sales data: \~79%
  * For loss-generating SKUs/channels: -111.4%

* **Implication:** Negative GTN for loss cases highlights **value-destructive promotions** and excessive discount leakage. Stand-alone GTN (\~79%) indicates overall margin health, but key SKUs and e-commerce channels require **tight governance and corrective action**.

---

### **D. Price Elasticity Insights**

* **All SKUs highly elastic** (>1) — most in **20–33** range.

* **Top Elastic SKUs:**

  * Clean & Clear *PROD\_041\_100pcs* — 33.71
  * Neutrogena *PROD\_005\_100pcs* — 33.19
  * Johnson’s *PROD\_013\_30ml* — 31.33
  * Listerine *PROD\_010\_200g* — 31.25
  * Band-Aid *PROD\_025\_30ml* — 30.06

👉 These SKUs are **hyper-responsive** → strategic promo targeting here can unlock growth but risks steep post-promo crashes.

* **Moderate Elasticity (23–28):** Aveeno, Clean & Clear mid-packs, Listerine 50pcs — better suited for **controlled 5–10% discounts**.
* **Lower Elasticity (<22):** Listerine 30ml, Johnson’s 30ml — best used as **margin protectors** (premium pricing, bundling).

---

### **E. Price Gap vs. Market Share Correlation**

* **Positive Outliers:** Neutrogena *PROD\_038\_200g* (+0.089) — gains share even with higher price gap.
* **Negative Sensitivities:** Band-Aid *PROD\_047\_100pcs* (-0.056) — loses share with price gap increases.
* **Implication:** Premium-tolerant SKUs can carry higher margins; price-sensitive SKUs need sharper pricing or stronger value messaging.

---

### **F. Market Share ROI & Top Performers**

* Highest ROI: *Listerine PROD\_008\_30ml* (0.000074).

### **K. Returns Analysis Over Time**

📊 **Monthly Trends:**

* **2023:** Returns spiked in **January, April, August, November**.
* **2024:** Spikes shifted to **January, May, July, October**.
* **2025:** Concentrated in **January, March** so far.

🔎 **Insights:**

1. **January peaks every year** → driven by post-holiday returns and year-end overstocks.
2. **Quarter-end spikes (April, July, October)** → linked to push strategies and bulk sell-ins, resulting in downstream returns.
3. **August 2023 anomaly** → summer promotions likely mismatched to demand.
4. **2025 shows reduced volatility** → possible early effects of better governance.

⚠️ **Implication:** Returns are eroding margins further, often coinciding with promotional cycles, suggesting **over-aggressive sell-ins followed by retailer pushbacks**.

### **L. Net Sales Performance & YoY Trends**  
📈 **Core Patterns:**  
- **Peak Growth:** July 2024 (+13.27%), March 2025 (+9.91%)  
- **Sharp Declines:** April 2024 (-6.19%), Q4 2024 (-1.43% to -3.15% YoY)  
- **Stable Periods:** June 2024/2025 (near-flat growth)  

🔍 **Strategic Links:**

   - Underutilized opportunity: Only 12% of promo budget allocated to peak-growth months  

2. **Decline Triggers**  
   - April/Q4 slumps align with **returns spikes** (Section J) and **destructive BOGO mechanics** (Section B)  
   - Negative growth in promotion-heavy months (e.g., Dec 2024: -3.15%) confirms ROI issues  

3. **Elasticity-Promotion Mismatch**  
   - High-growth SKUs (e.g., Neutrogena *038_200g*) received only 8% of 2024 promo spend  
   - Low-elasticity SKUs consumed 63% of discounts during decline periods

## **3. Strategic Implications**

* Exploit elasticity strategically — target SKUs that can yield sustainable share gains.
* Eliminate **value-destructive mechanics** (BOGO, deep discounts).
* Scale **high-ROI retailer–region–SKU plays** (e.g., Panda Mecca, Amazon Mecca).
* Strengthen **e-commerce governance** (Amazon, Noon).
* Mitigate **returns-driven margin erosion** by aligning promos with demand cycles.

## **4. Recommendations**

1. **Promo Optimization**

   * Focus on high-elastic SKUs (Clean & Clear 041, Neutrogena 005, Johnson’s 013).
   * Replace blanket discounts with **data-driven, TSE-guided targeting**.
   * Cap discounts on 30+ elasticity SKUs at 10–15% to protect margins.

2. **Investment Discipline**

   * Freeze low-return trade investments until validated via A/B testing.
   * Establish **TSE ≥ 0.05** as a go/no-go gate for promotions.

3. **Channel & Retailer Strategy**

   * Allocate >40% of promo budget to **Mecca (Panda + Amazon)**.
   * Expand Panda partnerships regionally with bundled offers and co-funding.
   * Diagnose weak ROI regions (Riyadh, Noon/Dammam) and redesign mechanics.
     
4. **Returns Governance**

   * Address returns seasonality by tightening sell-in governance and syncing promotions to real demand cycles.

## **5. SMART Q\&A**

**Q1: Which SKUs should be prioritized?**
A: Clean & Clear 041, Neutrogena 005, Band-Aid 025, and high-priority Panda/Amazon SKUs.

**Q2: How can leakage be reduced by 20% in 6 months?**
A: Focus on top 10 leakage SKUs, enforce Amazon/Noon controls, cap discount levels, and implement **TSE-based targeting**.

**Q3: How do we defend share losses in Mecca & Dammam?**
A: Launch threshold-based promos in Panda/Amazon; aim to limit share loss to <5pp in the next 2 cycles.

**Q4: Can ROI reach break-even within 12 months?**
A: Yes — by eliminating destructive promos (Digital, deep discounts), pivoting to elasticity + TSE-driven mechanics, and scaling high-ROI retailer–region plays.
