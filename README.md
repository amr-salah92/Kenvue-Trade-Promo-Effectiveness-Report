---

### **F. Competitive Share Loss Analysis (New)**

* **Methodology**:

  * Baseline = average market share during stable (non-decline) sales periods.
  * Decline periods = sales below average NetSales.
  * Calculated **Share Loss** as the difference between baseline and actual share.

* **Largest Share Losses**:

  * PROD\_001\_500ml — Mecca / Amazon, Dammam / Noon: **-22.65pp**
  * PROD\_018\_200g — Dammam / Noon: **-21.65pp**
  * PROD\_006\_50pcs — Mecca / Panda: **-21.65pp**
  * PROD\_010\_200g — Dammam / Amazon: **-20.65pp**

* **Biggest Competitive Threat Zones**:

  * Concentrated in **Noon, Amazon, and Panda**, especially in **Mecca, Dammam, and Riyadh**.
  * These periods represent **severe competitive pressure** — likely from rival promos or pricing shifts.

* **Lowest Share Losses (Possible Competitive Wins)**:

  * PROD\_008\_30ml — Khobar / Watsons: **+20.35pp**
  * PROD\_028\_500ml — Khobar / Noon: **+21.35pp**
  * PROD\_046\_500ml — Jeddah / Carrefour: **+21.35pp**

## **3. Strategic Implications**

1. **Shift from blanket discounting to precision targeting** — focus on high-elasticity SKUs and high-ROI region–retailer–SKU triples.
2. **Cut margin-destructive promos** — especially BOGO and deep price discounts.
3. **Rebuild trade investment programs** — current allocations generate no measurable uplift.
4. **Target competitive threat zones** — deploy defensive pricing/promo activity in regions where share loss exceeds 20pp.
5. **E-commerce governance** — Noon and Amazon require tighter control to curb leakage and competitive share erosion.

---

## **4. Next Steps**

* Develop **Elasticity × ROI × Leakage matrix** for SKU classification:

  * **Grow** — high elasticity, positive ROI, low leakage.
  * **Defend** — high share loss, high ROI potential.
  * **Fix** — high leakage, low ROI.
  * **Exit** — low elasticity, high leakage, negative ROI.
* Implement **share loss alert system** to detect competitive threats in real time.
* Pilot **targeted promo tests** in top ROI pockets before scaling.

## **5.Recommendations**

1. **Target Promo Spend Where It Works**

   * Shift promotional investment toward **high elasticity SKUs** (*e.g., Clean & Clear PROD\_041\_100pcs, Neutrogena PROD\_005\_100pcs*) and away from low elasticity items (*e.g., Listerine PROD\_009\_30ml*).
   * Pilot **smaller, data-driven promotions** in top ROI pockets such as *Dammam / Lulu / PROD\_030\_150ml* before scaling.

2. **Cut Margin-Destructive Mechanics**

   * Immediately reduce reliance on **BOGO** and deep **Price Discounts**, which have ROI of -5.08 and -3.82 respectively.
   * Replace with **value-add promotions** (bundles, cross-brand offers) that protect margin.

3. **Rebuild Trade Investment Approach**

   * Freeze underperforming spend categories (*e.g., Shelf Space Optimization, Co-op Advertising*).
   * Redirect funds toward **ROI-positive digital retail media** or **shopper-targeted campaigns**.

4. **Address Competitive Threat Zones**

   * Deploy defensive pricing or tactical promotions in SKUs/regions/retailers with **>20pp share loss** (*e.g., PROD\_001\_500ml in Mecca/Amazon*).
   * Introduce **localized competitor monitoring** to detect and respond to rival activity in real time.

5. **Strengthen E-commerce Channel Control**

   * Implement tighter discount governance on Amazon and Noon, which together account for **42% of total leakage**.
   * Negotiate retailer compliance on promo execution and price integrity.

6. **Introduce Continuous Performance Tracking**

   * Build a **Promo Effectiveness Dashboard** integrating elasticity, ROI, leakage, and share loss.
   * Refresh data monthly to enable agile decision-making.
