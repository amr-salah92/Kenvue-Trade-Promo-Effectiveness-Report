# **Kenvue Trade & Promo Effectiveness Report**

## **1. Executive Summary**

Kenvue’s current trade and promotional strategies are eroding profitability, with **negative ROI across all promo types**, **high discount leakage** concentrated in a small number of SKUs and retailers, and **market share losses** during sales downturns.

Even more critically, **price elasticity analysis reveals extreme sensitivity across nearly all SKUs**, meaning small pricing changes cause disproportionately large volume shifts — both opportunities and risks.

**Key Pain Points:**

* **SAR 93,671.46 total net losses** over the period.
* **42% of discount leakage** originates from e-commerce channels (*Amazon*, *Noon*).
* **All promo types** deliver negative ROI; BOGO and deep price discounts are most margin-destructive.
* **Price strategy misalignment** — heavy discounts applied to low-responsiveness SKUs.
* **Competitive share loss** concentrated in specific SKU–region–retailer combinations.
* **Elasticities in the 20–33 range** for most SKUs, magnifying both potential gains and risks from pricing decisions.

### **D. Price Elasticity Insights**

* **All SKUs highly elastic** (>1) — most in **20–33** range.

* **Top Elastic SKUs:**

  * Clean & Clear *PROD\_041\_100pcs* — 33.71
  * Neutrogena *PROD\_005\_100pcs* — 33.19
  * Johnson’s *PROD\_013\_30ml* — 31.33
  * Listerine *PROD\_010\_200g* — 31.25
  * Band-Aid *PROD\_025\_30ml* — 30.06

👉 These SKUs are **hyper-responsive** → strategic promo targeting here can unlock growth but risks steep post-promo crashes.

* **Moderate Elasticity (23–28):** Aveeno, Clean & Clear mid-packs, Listerine 50pcs — better suited for **controlled 5–10% discounts**.
* **Lower Elasticity (<22):** Listerine 30ml, Johnson’s 30ml — best used as **margin protectors** (premium pricing, bundling).

---

### **E. Price Gap vs. Market Share Correlation**

* **Positive Outliers:** Neutrogena *PROD\_038\_200g* (+0.089) — gains share even with higher price gap.
* **Negative Sensitivities:** Band-Aid *PROD\_047\_100pcs* (-0.056) — loses share with price gap increases.
* **Implication:** Premium-tolerant SKUs can carry higher margins; price-sensitive SKUs need sharper pricing or stronger value messaging.

---

### **J. Returns Analysis Over Time**

📊 **Monthly Trends:**

* **2023:** Returns spiked in **January, April, August, November**.
* **2024:** Spikes shifted to **January, May, July, October**.
* **2025:** Concentrated in **January, March** so far.

🔎 **Insights:**

1. **January peaks every year** → driven by post-holiday returns and year-end overstocks.
2. **Quarter-end spikes (April, July, October)** → linked to push strategies and bulk sell-ins, resulting in downstream returns.
3. **August 2023 anomaly** → summer promotions likely mismatched to demand.
4. **2025 shows reduced volatility** → possible early effects of better governance.

⚠️ **Implication:** Returns are eroding margins further, often coinciding with promotional cycles, suggesting **over-aggressive sell-ins followed by retailer pushbacks**.

---
## **3. Strategic Implications**

* Exploit elasticity strategically — target SKUs that can yield sustainable share gains.
* Eliminate **value-destructive mechanics** (BOGO, deep discounts).
* Scale **high-ROI retailer–region–SKU plays** (e.g., Panda Mecca, Amazon Mecca).
* Strengthen **e-commerce governance** (Amazon, Noon).
* Mitigate **returns-driven margin erosion** by aligning promos with demand cycles.
